`{photon}` is a simple interface and setup manager of the [photon](https://photon.komoot.io) OpenStreetMap geocoder. It features unstructured, structured, and reverse geocoding. The package allows requests to the public API but shines at setting up local instances to enable high-performance offline geocoding.

## Installation

To install the package from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("photon")
```

You can install the development version of photon from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jslth/photon")
```

## Usage

When loading `{photon}`, the package assumes that you want send geocoding requests to the public photon API. If you want to change this, you can use the workhorse function `new_photon()`. Otherwise, you can directly start geocoding.

```{r geocode}
library(photon)
places <- c("Paris", "Beijing", "Sao Paolo", "Kinshasa")

cities1 <- geocode(places, limit = 1, layer = "city")
cities1
```

Reverse geocoding means taking point geometries and returning their addresses or place names.

```{r reverse}
cities2 <- reverse(cities1$geometry, limit = 1, layer = "city")
cities2
```

```{r compare}
all.equal(cities1, cities2)
```


## Offline geocoding

`{photon}` is designed to facilitate offline geocoding. `new_photon()` can install photon locally. The following code would install and start photon covering the country of Germany in the current working directory.

```{r offline, eval=FALSE}
photon <- new_photon(path = "./photon", country = "Germany")
photon$start()
```

- The [`{photon}`](https://github.com/rCarto/photon) package by Timothée Giraud interfaces photon but does not allow the setup of local instances and was abandoned a while ago.
- The [`{revgeo}`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=revgeo) package by Michael Hudecheck implements reverse geocoding using (among others) photon.
- The [`{tidygeocoder}`](https://jessecambon.github.io/tidygeocoder/) and [`{nominatimlite}`](https://dieghernan.github.io/nominatimlite/) packages implement general (OSM) geocoding using web APIs.
